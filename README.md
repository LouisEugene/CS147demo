# CS147demo
Demo for iOS workshop (CS147)

This is a simple tracking app.
We use Parse for backend.

If you want to reuse the code for your project:
- Create a Parse account and change "setApplicationId" and "clientKey" on AppDelegate.m with your own identifiers
- Create a facebook developer account and change "FacebookAppID" on Info.plist with your own identifiers
