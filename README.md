# CS147demo
Demo for iOS workshop (CS147)

This is a simple tracking app.
We use Parse for backend.

If you want to reuse the code for your project:

PARSE:
- Create an account on Parse (https://www.parse.com)
- Create a new app (https://www.parse.com/apps)
- On Settings - Keys, you will find your "Application ID", "Client Key"
- On XCode, change "setApplicationId" and "clientKey" on AppDelegate.m with your own identifiers

FACEBOOK:
- Register for a Facebook developer account at https://developers.facebook.com/ and create a Facebook application if you haven't already.
- Follow Facebook's instructions for getting started with the Facebook SDK to create an app linked to the Facebook SDK.
- On XCode, change "FacebookAppID" on Info.plist with your own identifiers
